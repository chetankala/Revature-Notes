# Cloud Fundementals

## Cloud
The cloud is a metaphor for the internet. It refers to things you can access remotely over the internet. When something is in the cloud, it means it's stored on the internet servers instead of your computer's hard drive. 
The cloud is a vast network of remote servers around the globe. These servers store and manage data, run application, and deliver content and services like streaming videos, web mail, and coffee productivity software over the internet.
The cloud is not a physical entity. It is a system of millions of hard drives, computer servers, signal routers, and fiber-optic cables. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. Most cloud services can be accessed through a web browser like Firefox or Google Chrome. Some companies offer dedicated mobile apps.

## Cloud Applicatons
A cloud application is a software program that runs in the cloud, rather than on a local server or machine. Cloud applications are internet-based programs that use remote servers for processing logic and data storage. The front end of a cloud application may run as an app or in a web browser, but key elements, such as data storage, are online.
