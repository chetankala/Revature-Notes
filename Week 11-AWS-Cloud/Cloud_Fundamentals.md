# Cloud Fundementals

## Cloud
The cloud is a metaphor for the internet. It refers to things you can access remotely over the internet. When something is in the cloud, it means it's stored on the internet servers instead of your computer's hard drive. 
The cloud is a vast network of remote servers around the globe. These servers store and manage data, run application, and deliver content and services like streaming videos, web mail, and coffee productivity software over the internet.
The cloud is not a physical entity. It is a system of millions of hard drives, computer servers, signal routers, and fiber-optic cables. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. Most cloud services can be accessed through a web browser like Firefox or Google Chrome. Some companies offer dedicated mobile apps.

## Cloud Applicatons
A cloud application is a software program that runs in the cloud, rather than on a local server or machine. Cloud applications are internet-based programs that use remote servers for processing logic and data storage. The front end of a cloud application may run as an app or in a web browser, but key elements, such as data storage, are online.
Cloud applications are accessible from virtually any internet-connected device. Some examples of cloud applications include: Dropbox, Slack, Google Cloud, Google Docs, Office 365.
Cloud applications have several benefits, including:
    - Accessibility
    - Speed to market
    - Data security
Some examples of web-based applications include Amazon, eBay, banking websites, and Facebook.

## Cloud Service
Cloud services are a broad category of IT resources that are provided over the internet. These services include: Servers, Storage, Databases, Networking, Software, Analytics, Intelligence.
Cloud services are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. They allow customers to use powerful computing resources without having no purchase or maintain hardware and software.
Cloud services can also refer to professional services that support the selection, deployment, and ongoing management of various cloud-based resources.
Examples of cloud services include: Google Drive, Amazon EC2, Azure Key Vault

## Cloud Service Models
The three main cloud service models are:
Software as a Service (SaaS): A software licensing and distribution model that delivers a full application stack as a cloud service.
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides access to resources like virtual machines and virtual storage.
Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides access to the run time environment, deployment, and development tools for applications.
Each model satisfies a unique set of business requirements. Cloud service pricing models are categorized into pay per use, subscription-based, and hybrid.

## Cloud Deployment Models
The three most important cloud deployment models are:
Public Cloud: Available to the general public, and resources are shared between all users.
Private Cloud: A dedicated environment for one user (customer).
Hybrid Cloud: An organization uses interconnected private and public cloud infrastructure.
Cloud deployment models offer a choice of deployment models based on how much data users want to store and who will have access to the infrastructure.

## Cloud Service Providers
The biggest cloud service providers are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). These three companies have the largest market share, accounting for over 65% of spending on cloud infrastructure services.
Other cloud service providers include:

- Alibaba Cloud: a subsidiary of the Chinese firm Alibaba Group. It is the largest cloud computing company in China.
- Oracle offers cloud engineered systems, ERP solutions, and database software.
- Salesforce specializes in customer relationship management (CRM) software.
- Heroku offers simple pipelines and application hosting.

## Cloud Portal/Console
A cloud portal is a website that provides access to a cloud program. It's a centralized access point for managing cloud deployments and instances. Cloud portals are run using software that gives users access to the virtual environment of the cloud platform.

## Cloud API
Cloud APIs enable applications to communicate and transfer information to one another in the cloud. They also enable end users to access a cloud provider's appliation or service. For example, the Microsoft Azure REST API supports many services offered by the public Azure cloud.
Cloud APIs are the cornerstone or backbone of any public cloud based system. They act as a gateway to the cloud from your website or app.

## Cloud CLI
Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI) is a set of tools that allow developers and administrators to manage Cloud resources. The CLI provides a terminal command-line method to interact with the same cloud services that you can manage using the Cloud console/portal. You can use the CLI to perform many common platform tasks from the command line or through scripts and other automation.
