## Cloud
The cloud is a metaphor for the internet. It refers to things you can access remotely over the internt. When something is in the cloud, it means it's stored on the internet servers instead of your computer's hard drive. 
The cloud is a vast network of remote servers around the globe. These servers store and manage data, run application, and deliver content and services like streaming videos, web mail, and coffee productivity software over the internet.
