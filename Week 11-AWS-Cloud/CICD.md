# CI/CD

## DevOps Lifecycle
The DevOps lifecycle is a software development proccess that involves planning, building, integrating, testing, deploying, monitoring, operating, and providing feedback. The DevOps lifecycle is a methodology that software development teams use to bring products to market more quickly and efficiently.

## CI
Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves integrating code changes into a shared repository frequently. Developers should integrate their code daily, if not multiple times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. The goal is to have no intervening window between commit and build, so that developers can notice and correct errors immediately.

# CD
Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) is a software development practice that involves building, testing, *and releasing* software in short cycles. CD uses automation to speed up the release of new code. The goal of CD is to ensure that software can be released reliably at any time.

CD is a DevOps practice that involves:
- Building and testing improvements to software code
- Delivering those improvements to user environments
- Using automated tools
- Ensuring that code is always in a deployable state
- An example of CD is updating software automatically on a mobile phone. This allows developers to tackle different situations before delivering anything to customers.
