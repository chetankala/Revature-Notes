# Node JS

- A JavaScript runtime environment that is seperate from a browser.
- It is open source, cross-platform, and provides a large library of various JS modules which can simplify development.
- NodeJS is used by many industry leaders for server-side JS development including Neflix, Facebook, Walmart, Linkedin etc.

## Node Package Manager (NPM)

- This is a Node's built-in package manager. It is similar to things like scoop, chocolate, homebrew, or yum.
- Angular is installed by NPM which is built in a Node environment. Other libraries and frameworks that Angular uses can also be installed with NPM.
- CLI for NPM start with "npm".

## Angular

- A framework desgined by **Google**. It can be used to create reactive webpages, generally single page applications (SPA). 
- Angular is composed of three fundemental parts: **Modules**, **Components**, and **Services**. It contains support for directives, data binding, and dependency injection. 
    - Components are "sections" of a web page that are easily added or removed from the DOM. Components can be nested inside other components easily.
    - Services are pure logic files written in Typescript. They hold functions, variables, and classes that are generally shared across components.
    - Modules are collections of components, services, and other modules that organize the application. 
- Angular has a CLI that used "ng" for its commands.

## Typescript (TS)

- A superset of JavaScript
    - All valid JS is valid TS. (Everything that JS can do, TS must be able to do as well.) The reverse however is not true.
- TS is an open-source, object oriented, portable and strongly typed language. 
    - OOP - it supports classes, inheritence, interfaces, access modifiers etc.
    - TS files traditionally have ".ts" as their file extensions.
