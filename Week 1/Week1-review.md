# Week 1 Notes

# Fullstack Overview
- Full stack refers to the entire depth of a system
	- Frontend + backend
- Frontend: The visible part of the application on mobile devices / browsers, etc.
	- Usually built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JS)
- Backend: Servers, databases, and internal architecture that drives the application
	- Customer or end user does not have a direct interaction with this realm
- Fullstack developers have knowledge in both diciplines
	- Versatile enough to work on both frontend and backend
	- Organizations value fullstack developers since it's often necessary to have team memebers who understand how the entire system works

# Operating Systems
- Common OSes
	- Linux
	- Windows
	- Mac OS / Mac OS X
- Kernel: program at the core of an OS
	- Links the hardware and the software
	- Has full control over hardware resources
	- Performs arbitration between different processes that are runnning
	- Provides abstraction between applications and the hardware
- Process management
	- Process: an application in execution
		- Executed sequentially according to code instructions for that program
		- A program becomes a process when it starts
		- 5 different states: start, ready, running, waiting, terminated
- Threads
	- A thread is a flow of execution within a process
	- A thread keeps track of all instructions that need to be executed next
	- They contain all current variables being worked with and the execution history (stack memory)
- Scheduling
	- OS process manager is responsible for scheduling when each process gets execution time on the CPU
	- OS thread scheduler is responsible for scheduling when each thread within a process gets executed (for multi-threaded application)
- Memory Management
	- OS manages RAM (Random Access Memeory)
	- Processes are allocates space on RAM
	- OS also handles file IO (writing and reading from a disk)
- Unix Style commands
	- Unix is an old operating system on which many modern system are built
		- Linux is inspired by Unix (although they're not the same thing)
	- Commands
		- pwd
			- current directory
		- ls
			- list files + directories
		- cd
			- change directory
		- mkdir
			- make a new directory
		- touch
			- make a new blank file
		- cat
			- output contents of file
		- echo
			- print to console arguments passed in
		- grep
			- search for string in file/string input
		- diff
			- compare differences between files
		- rm
			- remove files or directory
		- cp
			- change files or directory
		- mv
			- move file or directory

# SDLC
- SDLC: Software development lifecycle
	- 6 core phases
		- Requirements phase
			- Defining what an applicaton is supposed to do
			- Establishing what resources are required for the project
		- Design phase
			- Modeling how an application will be put together
			- Architecture, UI, platform, programming paradigms, security, networking, databases
		- Implementation phase
			- Writing code
			- Multiple teams maybe working on a large project
			- Version control system often used such as **Git**
		- Testing phase
			- Making sure an application is working correctly according to the requirements
			- Manual or Automated
			- Testing helps reduce # of bugs/glitches in application
		- Deployment phase
			- Application is made available to users
			- Manual or Automated
			- DevOps is a modern process that is helpful for automation of deployment
			- Deployment can be complex if there are many different systems and/or distributed architecture, etc.
		- Maintenance phase
			- Users may discover bugs that weren't found during testing phase that the development team must fix
			- Additional features may be planned for future releases based on customer suggestion, etc.
- Waterfall
	- Classic method of development
	- Progress goes sequentially from one phase to another
		- Cannot go back to previous phase
	- Phase are fully completed before moving to the next
	- Advantages
		- Simple model
		- Easy to implement
		- Phases are clearly defined
		- Works well in short projects
	- Disadvantages
		- Not ideal for complex projects
		- Time may be wasted since each phase needs to be completed before moving to the next
		- Software product is not available for testing until later phases, which means bugs may not be caught until late in the development process
- Agile
	- Revolves around putting customer needs first
	- Focuses strongly on user experiences and customer input
		- Development is highly responsive to customer feedback
		- Software is released in iterations to respond to a changing market
		- Requires a strong team with excellent communication
	- 4 core values of Agile
		- Interactions and individuals over tools and processes
		- Working software over comprehensive documentation
		- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
		- Responding to change over following a plan
	- Advantages
		- Provides a responsive approach to development of software
		- Enhances flexibility / agility
	- Disadvantages
		- If not implemented properly, inadequate documentation can hinder knowledge transfer to new members on the development team
		- Having a less rigid model compared to waterfall can lead to disorganization if team members are not good at self-organization
	- Agile user stories
		- Format
			- `As a <role>`
			- `I want <goal>`
			- `So that <benefit>`
		- Acceptance Criteris
			- Conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete in terms of functionality
		- Example user story:
			- As an account manager
			- I want a sales report of my account sent to my inbox daily
			- So that I can monitor the sales progress of my customer portfolio
			- Acceptance criteria:
				- The report is sent to my inbox daily
				- The report contains the following sales details: ...
				- The report is in csv format
		- Requirements are written from the perspective of the user to keep the development team in line with customer needs and wants
	- Agile standup meetings
		- Usually a 15 minuite meeting
		- It happens daily in the morning
		- Each team member talks about 
			- What they worked on the previous day
			- What they will work on today
			- What issues/blockers/problems they are running into

# Git
- Version control system
	- Version control: the practice of tracking and managing code changes in a project
		- Save changes to project (creating new versions)
		- Revert to old versions
	- Version control system are tools that facilitate the process of version control
	- Git is the most popular VCS
- Repository types
	- Local repository
		- Local copy on your computer
	- Remote repository
		- Copy that exits on a repository hosting website (Github, Gitlab, BitBucket, etc.)
- File States
	- Modified
		- A file has been changed, added, or deleted but the modification has not been staged
	- Staged
		- A modified file is ready to be committed
	- Committed
		- Staged files have been saved to the local repository
- Git commands
	- `git init` creates a new local repository
	- `git remote add` links the local repository with a remote repository
	- `git clone` creates a local repository that is a copy of an already exisiting remote repository (ex. a repository that already exists on GitHub)
	- `git status` to view status of the repository and to see modified files and/or files ready to be committed
	- `git commit` to commit changes to local repository
	- `git log` to view newly created commit
	- `git push` to push commit to remote repository

# Java Fundementals
- High level programming language
- Features include:
	- Highl object oriented
	- Strongly typed: values are not implicitly converted between types
	- Strictly typed: variables are declared with a type that cannot be changed
- Benefits:
	- Write once run anywhere
	- Widley used with extensive 3rd party libraries + frameworks that are open source
	- Automatic memory management
- Disadvantages
	- Can be inefficient with memory management at times
	- All users must have a JRE installed on a computer to run Java programs
	- Forces OOP to be used
	- Takes time to compile code before it can be run 
	- Licensing
- JDK vs JRE vs JVM
	- JDK: Java Development Kit:
		- Contains a **compiler** that turns source code into byte code
		- DevTools, debugger, documentation tools, etc.
		- JRE
	- JRE: Java Runtime Environment
		- Built-in libraries
			- ex. String class, System class, Math class, collections API, etc.
		- JVM
	- JVM: Java Virtual Machine
		- Runs byte code and issues instructions to the machine on how to run the program
			- Contains a JIT (Just in Time) compiler that reads byte code line by line and issues low-level commands to the computer while program is running 
- Primitive Type
	- 8 primitives
		- byte
			- 8 bit integer values
		- short
			- 16 bit integer values
		- char
			- 16 bit unicode characters
		- int
			- 32 bit integer values
		- long
			- 64 bit integer values
			- "L"
		- float
			- 32 bit floating point values
			- "f"
		- double
			- 64 bit floating point values
- Control Flow
	- If statement: used to execute a block of code if true
		- else if: is another if statement chained to a previous that will run if the previous was false
		- else: runs if if, and all else ifs are false
	- While loop
		- runs a block of code repeatedly while a specific condition is true
	- Do-while loop
		- runs a block of code first, and then evaluates a condition to see if it's true before looping again
		- Do-while loops are guaranteed to run at least once
	- For loop
		- A loop with 3 parts
		- Declaration block: create a "counter" variable
		- Conditional block: runs loop if condition is true
		- Increment block: used to change the counter variable's value (could also be used for decrementing)
	- Switch statements
		- Use a specific variable and match its value against various "cases"
	- Break and continue
		- Used to exit a loop without further evaluation
		- **continue** used to stop execution of current block and proceed to the next block
- Boolean expressions
	- `==` Check equality of two values
		- For primitive variables, checks whether values are equal
		- For reference variables, checks whether the two variables are pointing to the same object
		- `>` Greater than
		- `<` Less than
		- `>=` Greater than or equal to
		- `<=` Less than or equal to
		- `!` Reverse value of boolean
		- `&&` AND
			- true && false -> true
			- everything else is false
		- `||` OR
			- false || false -> false
			- everthing else is true
- Strings
	- Objects in Java, not primitives
	- Sequences of charanters
	- Immutable (when a String object is created in memory, its characters cannot be changed)
	- Double quotes represent string literals
	- Common string method
		- `.equals(Object o)`
		- `.charAt(int index)`
		- `.concat(String s)`
		- `.contains(CharSequence cs)`
		- `.toCharArray()`
		- `.substring(x, y)`
		- `.length()`
		- `.split(regex)`
		- `.toLowerCase()`
		- `.toUpperCase()`
		- `.trim()`
- Array
	- A contiguous block of memory that stores a group of sequentially stored elements of the same type
	- Fixed in size: once an array is created, its size cannot be changed
	- Arrays can be used for both primitive and object types
	- Ways to create an array
		- `int[] myInts = new int[5];`
			- Creates and array of size 5
			- `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
		- `int[] myInts = new int[] {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};`
			- Creates an array of size 5
			- Pre-populates with values
			- `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`
		- `int[] myInts = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}`
			- Same as above, but without using `new int[]`
- Classes and Objects
	- Classes are blueprints for creating objects in memory
		- Classes are named with CamelCase convention
		- Fields and methods are named with lowercase camelCase
	- Objects represent real world entities / things
		- Objects possess properties (fields) + behaviors (methods)
		- An object is created using a constructor defined in a class
			- `new` keyword is used
		- Objects can be referred to via reference variables
		- `ex. Person p = new Person("Chetan", "Student");`
- Object class
	- Ultimate parent class of all objects
	- Every object in Java inherits the fields/methods defined in the Object class
	- If a class does not explicitly inherit another class using the `extends` keyword, it will automatically directly inherit the Object class
	- Important methods
		- toString(): returns a String thart represents the object, which will also be printed out if System.out.println is used to print the object
			- `className@hashCode` by default
		- equals(): compares object to another to determine equality
			- `==` by default
			- Often overridden to compare properties of two objects
		- hashCode(): creates a hash identifier for an object that is useful for collections such as HashSet or HashMap
- Classes vs Objects
	- Classes are blueprints for objects
		- A class is declared once
	- Objects are instances of a class
		- Multiple (as many as required) objects can be created from a single class
- Scanner class
	- Used to create Strings from an external source
	- Often used to read from text files or to accept input from the console
	- Console is represented by System.in (standard input)
	- `Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)`
- Methods
	- Functions attached to classes/objects that can be called at different times to run as necessary
	- Methods have
		- inputs (parameters/arguments)
		- outputs (returned values)
		- code block (contains logic should be executed within the method)
	- Method signature
		- `<access modifier> <optional non-access modifiers(s)> <return type> methodName(<optional parameters(s)>) { }`
- Packages
	- A way to organize classes
	- Related classes are typically placed together in a package
	- Naming convention of package is "reverse domain naming"
		- `com.revaturepro`
		- lowercase
	- Subpackages
