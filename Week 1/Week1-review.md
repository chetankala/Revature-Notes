# Week 1 Notes

# Fullstack Overview
- Full stack refers to the entire depth of a system
	- Frontend + backend
- Frontend: The visible part of the application on mobile devices / browsers, etc.
	- Usually built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JS)
- Backend: Servers, databases, and internal architecture that drives the application
	- Customer or end user does not have a direct interaction with this realm
- Fullstack developers have knowledge in both diciplines
	- Versatile enough to work on both frontend and backend
	- Organizations value fullstack developers since it's often necessary to have team memebers who understand how the entire system works

# Operating Systems
- Common OSes
	- Linux
	- Windows
	- Mac OS / Mac OS X
- Kernel: program at the core of an OS
	- Links the hardware and the software
	- Has full control over hardware resources
	- Performs arbitration between different processes that are runnning
	- Provides abstraction between applications and the hardware
- Process management
	- Process: an application in execution
		- Executed sequentially according to code instructions for that program
		- A program becomes a process when it starts
		- 5 different states: start, ready, running, waiting, terminated
- Threads
	- A thread is a flow of execution within a process
	- A thread keeps track of all instructions that need to be executed next
	- They contain all current variables being worked with and the execution history (stack memory)
- Scheduling
	- OS process manager is responsible for scheduling when each process gets execution time on the CPU
	- OS thread scheduler is responsible for scheduling when each thread within a process gets executed (for multi-threaded application)
- Memory Management
	- OS manages RAM (Random Access Memeory)
	- Processes are allocates space on RAM
	- OS also handles file IO (writing and reading from a disk)
- Unix Style commands
	- Unix is an old operating system on which many modern system are built
		- Linux is inspired by Unix (although they're not the same thing)
	- Commands
		- pwd
			- current directory
		- ls
			- list files + directories
		- cd
			- change directory
		- mkdir
			- make a new directory
		- touch
			- make a new blank file
		- cat
			- output contents of file
		- echo
			- print to console arguments passed in
		- grep
			- search for string in file/string input
		- diff
			- compare differences between files
		- rm
			- remove files or directory
		- cp
			- change files or directory
		- mv
			- move file or directory

# SDLC
- SDLC: Software development lifecycle
	- 6 core phases
		- Requirements phase
			- Defining what an applicaton is supposed to do
			- Establishing what resources are required for the project
		- Design phase
			- Modeling how an application will be put together
			- Architecture, UI, platform, programming paradigms, security, networking, databases
		- Implementation phase
			- Writing code
			- Multiple teams maybe working on a large project
			- Version control system often used such as **Git**
		- Testing phase
			- Making sure an application is working correctly according to the requirements
			- Manual or Automated
			- Testing helps reduce # of bugs/glitches in application
		- Deployment phase
			- Application is made available to users
			- Manual or Automated
			- DevOps is a modern process that is helpful for automation of deployment
			- Deployment can be complex if there are many different systems and/or distributed architecture, etc.
		- Maintenance phase
			- Users may discover bugs that weren't found during testing phase that the development team must fix
			- Additional features may be planned for future releases based on customer suggestion, etc.
- Waterfall
	- Classic method of development
	- Progress goes sequentially from one phase to another
		- Cannot go back to previous phase
	- Phase are fully completed before moving to the next
	- Advantages
		- Simple model
		- Easy to implement
		- Phases are clearly defined
		- Works well in short projects
	- Disadvantages
		- Not ideal for complex projects
		- Time may be wasted since each phase needs to be completed before moving to the next
		- Software product is not available for testing until later phases, which means bugs may not be caught until late in the development process
- Agile
	- Revolves around putting customer needs first
	- Focuses strongly on user experiences and customer input
		- Development is highly responsive to customer feedback
		- Software is released in iterations to respond to a changing market
		- Requires a strong team with excellent communication
	- 4 core values of Agile
		- Interactions and individuals over tools and processes
		- Working software over comprehensive documentation
		- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
		- Responding to change over following a plan
	- Advantages
		- Provides a responsive approach to development of software
		- Enhances flexibility / agility
	- Disadvantages
		- If not implemented properly, inadequate documentation can hinder knowledge transfer to new members on the development team
		- Having a less rigid model compared to waterfall can lead to disorganization if team members are not good at self-organization
	- Agile user stories
		- Format
			- `As a <role>`
			- `I want <goal>`
			- `So that <benefit>`
		- Acceptance Criteris
			- Conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete in terms of functionality
		- Example user story:
			- As an account manager
			- I want a sales report of my account sent to my inbox daily
			- So that I can monitor the sales progress of my customer portfolio
			- Acceptance criteria:
				- The report is sent to my inbox daily
				- The report contains the following sales details: ...
				- The report is in csv format
		- Requirements are written from the perspective of the user to keep the development team in line with customer needs and wants
	- Agile standup meetings
		- Usually a 15 minuite meeting
		- It happens daily in the morning
		- Each team member talks about 
			- What they worked on the previous day
			- What they will work on today
			- What issues/blockers/problems they are running into

# Git
- Version control system
	- Version control: the practice of tracking and managing code changes in a project
		- Save changes to project (creating new versions)
		- Revert to old versions
	- Version control system are tools that facilitate the process of version control
	- Git is the most popular VCS
- Repository types
	- Local repository
		- Local copy on your computer
	- Remote repository
		- Copy that exits on a repository hosting website (Github, Gitlab, BitBucket, etc.)
- File States
	- Modified
		- A file has been changed, added, or deleted but the modification has not been staged
	- Staged
		- A modified file is ready to be committed
	- Committed
		- Staged files have been saved to the local repository
- Git commands
	- `git init` creates a new local repository
	- `git remote add` links the local repository with a remote repository
	- `git clone` creates a local repository that is a copy of an already exisiting remote repository (ex. a repository that already exists on GitHub)
	- `git status` to view status of the repository and to see modified files and/or files ready to be committed
	- `git commit` to commit changes to local repository
	- `git log` to view newly created commit
	- `git push` to push commit to remote repository

# Java Fundementals
- High level programming language
- Features include:
	- Highl object oriented
	- Strongly typed: values are not implicitly converted between types
	- Strictly typed: variables are declared with a type that cannot be changed
- Benefits:
	- Write once run anywhere
	- Widley used with extensive 3rd party libraries + frameworks that are open source
	- Automatic memory management
- Disadvantages
	- Can be inefficient with memory management at times
	- All users must have a JRE installed on a computer to run Java programs
	- Forces OOP to be used
	- Takes time to compile code before it can be run 
	- Licensing
- JDK vs JRE vs JVM
	- JDK: Java Development Kit:
		- Contains a **compiler** that turns source code into byte code
		- DevTools, debugger, documentation tools, etc.
		- JRE
	- JRE: Java Runtime Environment
		- Built-in libraries
			- ex. String class, System class, Math class, collections API, etc.
		- JVM
	- JVM: Java Virtual Machine
		- Runs byte code and issues instructions to the machine on how to run the program
			- Contains a JIT (Just in Time) compiler that reads byte code line by line and issues low-level commands to the computer while program is running 
- Primitive Type
	- 8 primitives
		- byte
		- short
		- char
		- int
		- long
		- float
		- double
