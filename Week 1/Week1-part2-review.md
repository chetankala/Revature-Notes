# Week 1 Notes

# Memory Management
- Call Stack
    - Keeps track of execution in a program
    - When a method is executed, it is placed on top of the call stack
    - When the method is done executing, it is popped off the call stack
    - All methods that are in the call stack are in the process of execution, with the method at the top of the call stack the one that is actively being executed line by line
    - Each method is a "stack frame"
    - Stack frame contains all of the method scoped / block scope variables currently
- Heap
    - Contains objects
    - References variables (such as method/block scoped variables) in the call stack contain the memory address location of an object in the heap
    - A special location in the heap called the **string pool** is used to store literal objects 
        - A string literal may be used multiple times in an application such as `"hello"`, but only one object will exist in the string pool for that
- Garbage Collection
    - De-allocation of memory that objects occupy is performed by the garbage collector
    - When an object no longer has any references, the garbage collector will destroy the object and free up the memory the object was occupying
    - Garbage collector is a piece of software that runs in the background on a periodic basis
    - The JVM schedules when the garbage collector runs
        - We do not have control over this process
        - It is not possible to force garbage collection to run
    - We can request the JVM to run the garbage collector
        - `System.gc()`
        - `System.runFinalize()`
        - `Runtime.getRuntime().gc()`

# Pillars of OOP
- Inheritence
    - Enables a class to gain the features (fields + methods) of another class and expand upon those if necessary
    - Establishes an IS-A relationship
    - Inheritence helps minimize redundancies in code since related classes can have a parent/super class that contains shared characteristics
    - `extends` keyword is used to indicate the parent class of a class being defined
    - In Java, only a single class can be inherited. However, the parent class can also inherit from a class, creating a hierarchy
    - Terminologies
        - Subclass (child class)
        - Superclass (parent class)
- Polymorphism
    - Means "many forms"
    - Methods can take on different forms via method overloading + overriding
    - Method overriding
        - Where a method in the parent class is redefined in a child class
        - Used to provide a specific implementation of a method already provided in the parent class
        - Overriding is known as runtime polymorphism
            - While the program is running, the JVM figures out which method to use
        - Overriding rules
            - Child class method has the same name as the parent class method
            - Same parameters
            - Same return type (or covariant type)
            - Same access modifiers (or more accessible)
    - Method overloading
        - Where two or more methods in the same class have the same name
            - Overloading helps to simplify the number of method names
            - Examples in Java:
                - `System.out.println(...)`
                - `println(int x)` 
                - `println(double x)` 
                - `println(String str)`  
                - `println(char c)`
        - Overloading is known as compile-time polymorphism
        - Rules
            - Methods are in the same class
            - Same name
            - Different number of parameters and/or type of parameters
- Abstraction
    - "Hiding implementation details"
    - "Taking something concrete and turning it into an idea"
        - Ex. CombustionCar and ElectricCar are both Car
        - Ex. Circle and Square are both Shapes
        - Ex: Dog and Cat are both Animals
    - Abstraction is accomplished through abstract classes and interfaces
    - Abstract class
        - Can contain abstract methods
        - Also can have non-abstract methods
        - Cannot be instantiated
    - Interfaces
        - Can only have abstract methods (until Java 8 introduced the defualt keyword)
            - default keyword allows for the defining of non-abstract methods in interfaces
        - Cannot instantiate an interface
        - fields in an interface are public static final implicitly
        - methods in an interface are public abstract implicitly
    - A class can extend only one class (whether abstract or concrete)
    - A class can implement as many interfaces as desired
- Encapsulation 
    - Enclosing data and methods into a single unit (class)
        - Fields and methods interact with each other within an object created from a class
        - Methods can access and/or modify the value of the fields
    - Data-hiding is a best practice for encapsulation 
        - Used to prevent other developers from modifying values in ways that are not intended by the original creator of a class
            - ex. age should only be incremented, not decreased for a Person object
        - Use access modifiers (private, default, protected, public) to restrict access
        - Typically, fields should be restricted as much as reasonably possible
    - Getter/setter methods
        - Getter methods: used to access a property via a method
        - Setter methods: used to set a property via a method

# Maven
- Dependency manager and build tool
    - `pom.xml` file
        - Contains the settings for the Maven project
        - Dependencies utilized as listed in the pom.xml and automatically downloaded
        - Plugins can also be configured when using Maven to build the project
    - Dependency manager: when writing Java applications, many external libraries may be used
        - Maven helps to automatically download + manage those dependencies
    - Build tool: when writing Java applications, before deploying the application, the project must be built
        - build: the process of creating a build artifact
        - build artifact: a deployable file representing the application such as a .jar file
    - Directory structure:
        - `src/main/java`: where the project source code should go
        - `src/main/resources`: where any custom configuration files and other resources go
        - `src/test/java`: where the automated test code should go
        - `src/test/resources`: where any resources that support the test code go

# JUnit
- A unit testing framework for Java
    - Can be included into our project via Maven (putting the dependencies into the pom.xml file)
    - A way to help us structure test cases
        - `@Test` annotation
            - Method is treated as a test case
        - Annotation
            - @Test
            - @BeforeAll
            - @AfterAll
            - @BeforeEach
            - @AfterEach
        - Assertions
            - Give JUnit the ability to fail a test if expected does not match equal
            - Assertions.assertEquals(expected, actual)
            - Assertions.assertTrue(boolean)
            - Assertions.assertFalse(boolean)
            - Assertions.assertArrayEquals([] expected, [] actual)
            - Assertions.assertNull(...)
            - Assertions.fail()

# Collections API
- Collection hierarchy
    - Iterable interface
        - Collection interface
            - List interface
                - ArrayList class
                - LinkedList class
                - Vector class
            - Queue interface
                - LinkedList class
                - PriorityQueue class
            - Set interface
                - HashSet class
                - TreeSet class
    - Map interface (not part of the Collection interface hierarchy)
        * HashTable class
        * HashMap class
        * TreeMap class
- Collections class
    - A utility class that contains static methods that are useful for operating on collections
    - Collections.sort(myList)
    - Collections.sort(myList, Collections.reverseOrder())
- Java's implementation of common data structure
    - List
        - Data stored in sequential order and accessible by an index
        - Size can be expanded unlike an Array
        - Two common types
            - ArrayList
                - Uses an array behind the scenes
                - When the array runs out of space, a new array is created that is 1.5x the size of the old array
                - Elements from the old array are copied over
            - LinkedList
                - Uses node objects linked to each other
                - Each node stores a single value and links to the previous and next node
        - Primary operations
            - .add(E element)
            - .add(int index, E element)
            - .set(int index, E element)
            - .get(int index)
            - .remove(int index)
            - .remove(E element)
            - .size()
            - .clear()
            - .contains(E element)
    - Set
        - Collection of unique values
