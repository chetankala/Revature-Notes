## Python
- Python is a programming language that is interpreted rather than compiled
    - With Java, we had to compile our code using javac command
    - And then, we would run our compiled code
- Python is "interpreted" line by line rather than compiled all at once
- Syntax - When set up blocks of code (such as if-statements, for-loops, etc.), we use colons and indentations as opposed to curly braces
- Variable Types - when we declare variables in python, we don't explicitly state the data types, and we can change/re-assign to a new variable type after instantiation
- Make sure to include .py extension on all Python files

### Running a Python Script:
- Make sure we have Python installed on your device (Workspace one if you have a work computer)
- To test this installation out, run python from our command line
